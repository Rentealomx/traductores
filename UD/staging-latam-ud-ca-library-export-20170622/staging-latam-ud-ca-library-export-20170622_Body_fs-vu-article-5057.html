    It’s been an amazing first year for <a href="http://www.urbandecay.com/uvedge" target="_blank">The Ultraviolet Edge</a>, our global initiative to empower women. By helping to fund organizations that fight for the rights of women everywhere, we encourage all women to embrace their individuality in everything they do. To us, that&#39;s the definition of beauty with an edge™. In honor of #GivingTuesday, here’s a quick look at the organizations we’ve helped so far.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Women’s Global Empowerment Fund</b><br/>
    <br/>
    Women’s Global Empowerment Fund supports women through economic, social and political programs; creating opportunities while addressing inequality, strengthening families and building communities. By providing women in post-conflict Uganda with microloans and a broad range of leadership development and education programs, WGEF helps them to gain economic stability and independence while rebuilding their lives and communities.<br/>
