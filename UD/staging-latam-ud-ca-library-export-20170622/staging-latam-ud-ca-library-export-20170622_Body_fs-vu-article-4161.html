    We are big fans of Dorothy the band here at #UDHQ and you might recognize their song, “After Midnight” in our <a href="$url('Page-Show','cid','fs-article-3397')$" title="I'm a Beauty Junkie">#ImABeautyJunkie video</a>. We sat down with lead vocalist Dorothy Martin for a quick Q &amp; A -<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>What is your favorite song to perform and why?</b><br/>
    <br/>
    Medicine Man because it comes from such a deeply personal place. It’s tied to a real experience that I’ve had that I would describe as magical and “part of the design.”<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>What women inspire you?</b><br/>
    <br/>
    My mother, my two best friends Grace and Kristen and great writers and poets like Jane Austen and Maya Angelou.<br/>
    <br/>

    <b>What are some of your beauty must-haves?</b><br/>
    <br/>
    Cefine Herb-Clear Gel, Dr. Dennis Gross Peel Pads for when I’m on the road and Elta MD SPF. My best friend Kristen is an esthetician and always sneaks goodies like these into my suitcase to keep my skin nice when I travel!<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>What are you listening to on your iPhone right now?</b><br/>
    <br/>
    I’m listening to Howlin’ Wolf and Outkast on Pandora.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>What gives you an edge?</b><br/>
    <br/>
    I like being relaxed and casual. I love sneakers, and just recently started wearing my hair natural and curly again. I think when you don’t try so hard to overdo things and appreciate what you have naturally, it gives you an edge.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>I feel like a rockstar when…</b><br/>
    <br/>
    I’m onstage and people are clapping and chanting along to our songs! Connecting to the audience is such an elating feeling.<br/>
