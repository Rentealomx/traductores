<h2>Why women's rights?</h2>
<p>Wende Zomnir (cofounder and chief creative officer of Urban Decay) is, and always has always been, deeply passionate about women's rights. Having supported organizations that empower women for years, she saw an opportunity for UD to get involved and help make a difference.</p><br />
<p>When you invest in women, everyone benefits. Research shows when given the resources and opportunities to work, women invest 90% of their income back into their families and communities. This not only enables them to put food on the table, but also allows them to pay for school and invest in their children's future. Educating and empowering women has proved to decrease violence (domestic and regional), decrease child marriage, and increase reproductive responsibility and health.*</p>

<h2>How is Gwen involved?</h2>
<p>As part of our efforts, we'll be recognizing inspirational women who rock our world&mdash;starting with a woman we've admired forever: Gwen Stefani. Like us, she has a history of breaking down barriers and hails from Orange County, California. We dig Gwen's innate ability to set trends and defy expectations. She also shares our passion for empowering women and will help give this initiative the attention it deserves.</p>
</div>
<div id="faq3">
<h2>Why work with multiple organizations?</h2>
<p>Women's rights is a complicated landscape with many worthy causes, so we decided to pool together the money raised by The Ultraviolet Edge, which will give us the flexibility to support a variety of organizations that are doing incredible things to empower women.</p>
</div>
<div id="faq4">
<h2>How much are you donating?</h2>
<p>For year one, our goal is to raise $500,000 through the sale of our limited-edition Enigma Eyeshadow Primer Potion. This is the first in a series of limited-edition products that will fund The Ultraviolet Edge. Over the next five years, our goal is to donate three million dollars to causes that support women.</p>
</div>
<div id="faq5">
<h2>How do you decide what organizations to donate to?</h2>
<p>There are many organizations doing amazing work to further women's rights around the world. We do extensive research to pick those organizations we feel embody the mission of The Ultraviolet Edge, and that have been verified and/or awarded by a third party.</p>
</div>
<div id="faq6">
<h2>Where can I buy Enigma Eyeshadow Primer Potion?</h2>
<p>Enigma Eyeshadow Primer Potion is available at Urban Decay stores, at <a href="$url('Product-Show','pid','516')$">UrbanDecay.com</a> and through our U.S. retail partners.</p>
</div>
<div id="faq7">
<h2>Is this an international initiative?</h2>
<p>This is a global initiative and the money raised through The Ultraviolet Edge will fund organizations all over the world that help empower women. For our first launch, however, the product will only be sold in the U.S. In 2016, this program will roll out worldwide. </p>

<!-- <div id="faq10">
<h2>Why is Enigma sold out?</h2>
<p>Thanks to the overwhelming amount of support for this initiative, we have sold out of Enigma Eyeshadow Primer Potion, reaching our goal of $500,000 for year one! We plan to bring back an Ultraviolet Edge product in 2016 to continue to raise funds and awareness for women's empowerment. In the meantime, continue to follow us for updates. We'll be sharing more about the women who rock our world and the organizations we support.</p>
