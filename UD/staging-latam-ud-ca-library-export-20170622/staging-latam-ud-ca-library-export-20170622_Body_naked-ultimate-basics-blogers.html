Then, we let her have at it in our UD Confessional.

As soon as she stepped into our UD Confessional, we knew we were in for something awesome. And, of course, she didn’t disappoint. Using two cool-toned Naked Ultimate Basics shades (both matte, just like all the shades in the palette) and our matte navy blue shade of Vice Lipstick, she created a look that is stunningly unique…and cool, just like Leyla." data-title="Cool Matte Look Tutorial by Leyla Rose | Naked Ultimate Basics | Urban Decay">

The final result was obviously beautiful. For her look, Kaushal went for a matte brown smoky eye with a matching matte brown lip. The monochromatic theme—with the addition of burnt orange on the eye (using Extra Bitter, Kaushal's favorite Naked Ultimate Basics shade)—looks effortless, yet stunning and is perfect for day or night." data-title="MATTE SMOKY LOOK TUTORIAL BY KAUSHAL BEAUTY | NAKED ULTIMATE BASICS | URBAN DECAY">
