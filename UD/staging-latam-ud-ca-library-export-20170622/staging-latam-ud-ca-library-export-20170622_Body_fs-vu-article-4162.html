    Los Angeles based designers Sara Smith and Mara Rothbart launched their uniquely beautiful and everyday inspired jewelry collection, <a href="http://www.smithandmara.com/" target="_blank">SMITH+MARA</a>, in 2012.<br/>
    <br/>
    Sara and Mara have always had a strong passion for simplicity, beauty and fashion, and here at #UDHQ we can’t get enough of the matchstick earrings (you may have also seem them <a href="http://urbandecay.tumblr.com/post/98154239587/jewelry-we-love-i-mean-who-doesnt-love-a-good" target="_blank">here</a>). These chicks rock our world, so we jumped at the chance to chat with Sara and Mara to get the inside scoop on what inspires them -<br/>

    <b>What is your favorite piece of jewelry and why?</b><br/>
    <br/>
    <b>MARA:</b> Right now my favorite piece is our 14K Gold Pave Diamond Opal Pyramid Ring. The opal is one of the most gorgeous stones, especially when it catches the light. It reminds me of a rainbow surrounded by tiny diamonds. Every time I look at my hand it blows me away how something so special and beautiful can be found in nature.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>SARA:</b> We are about to launch a collection of stackable cuff bracelets that can be worn one at a time, or as a group for a bolder statement. I am obsessed with them - I literally never take them off. They are so comfortable and they are so fun to mix and match. My two favorites right now are our turquoise and diamond baguette versions. They are so unique and make great everyday staples.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>What women inspire you?</b><br/>
    <br/>
    <b>MARA:</b> The women who directly inspire me are the strong women in my family. Both of my grandmothers have been amazing in their own way. My mother’s mother is the most intelligent, creative, well-read woman, who has also taught me her incredible Mexican cooking skills. My father’s mother had an amazing fashion sense and inspired me to get involved in jewelry as she was the second generation in my family’s business. She was a firecracker of a woman who always inspired me and made me laugh. My mother is one of the strongest women I have ever come across. She pushed me to have the work ethic I have today.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>SARA: </b> My daughter definitely inspires me on a personal level. She inspires me to want to be the best role model I can for her. I never want her to grow up feeling like there is anything she can’t do because she’s a woman - so I feel such a sense of responsibility to show her that we, as women, are strong and can achieve anything. I look forward to her getting older and seeing what Mara and I have built and perhaps wanting to be part of it.<br/>

    <b>What are some of your beauty must-haves?</b><br/>
    <br/>
    <b>MARA:</b> I have a pretty strict beauty regimen which includes always washing my face morning and night with Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Facial Cleanser followed by Eau Thermale Avene make-up remover and toner, and topping it off with a twice weekly Koh Gen Doh Gommage scrub. When I am not giving myself my weekly at home facial, I always make sure to apply an oil free moisturizer with at least SPF 30 and Shiseido Benefiance Wrinkle24 eye cream. My all time favorite masks are the Eve Lomb Rescue mask as well as the SKII eye masks.. my skin literally glows when I am done. For makeup I usually just wear a little loose powder, the <a href="$url('Product-Show','pid','359')$" >Urban Decay Naked Flushed</a> and a few swipes of mascara.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>SARA:</b> I’m really into skincare - so I try to do what I can to take care of my face, cause you only get one! I make sure to wash my face twice a day with Eau Thermale Avene Cleansing Milk. After washing, I use a Murad Hydrating Toner followed by Rodial Stemcell Super-food Facial Oil - the oil is AMAZING and instantly hydrates my dry skin. I also never go without eye cream - right now I’m into my Neocutis Lumiere Bio-Restorative Eye Cream. Once a week I make sure to exfoliate with Koh Gen Doh Gommage scrub - it is honestly the greatest thing ever. It makes your skin feel brand new! In terms of daily make up, I keep it pretty simple. I never leave the house without under-eye concealer, mascara and blush from my <a href="$url('Product-Show','pid','359')$" >Naked Flushed</a>.<br/>

    <b>We are big fans of the Matchstick Collection, what was the inspiration behind it?</b><br/>
    <br/>
    <b>MARA:</b> The inspiration behind the matchstick pieces was my grandparents’ collection of matchbooks. Whenever they traveled out of the country, state or even in their own neighborhood, they would pick up a matchbook to document their adventures together. I inherited hundreds of matchbooks that each tell a little story of an experience and reminds me to always travel more.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>What gives you an edge?</b><br/>
    <br/>
    <b>SARA + MARA:</b> As designers we think our innovative pieces and personal style gives us an edge. We’re both a little bit girly - but not overly feminine. Our favorite color is black and we choose pants over dresses any day of the week. We’ve come across a lot of people feel that the only way to make a statement with their style is to wear loud, chunky, large pieces - we think it takes a certain skill to know how to make a simple, understated and classic statement. It’s with that concept in mind that we design our everyday style staples.<br/>
