<h2>EMPOWERING WOMEN AROUND THE WORLD</h2>
<p class="uvedge-text">Urban Decay has always stood for the empowerment of women&mdash;from the products we create to the causes we support. When we launched in 1996, the prestige beauty market was a sea of pink, red and beige. We gave women the alternative makeup colors they craved and challenged them to defy the stereotypical notions of beauty. But it doesn't end with makeup. Urban Decay announces the launch of The Ultraviolet Edge, our global initiative to empower women. By helping to fund organizations that fight for the rights of women everywhere, we encourage all women to embrace their individuality in everything they do. To us, that's the definition of beauty with an edge<sup>&trade;</sup>.</p>
<p class="uvedge-text uvedge-text-wide">Women's rights is a complicated landscape with many worthy causes, so we decided to pool together the money raised by The Ultraviolet Edge, which will give us the flexibility to support a variety of organizations that are doing incredible things to empower women. With this new initiative, we plan to donate three million dollars to causes that support women over the next five years alone.</p>
