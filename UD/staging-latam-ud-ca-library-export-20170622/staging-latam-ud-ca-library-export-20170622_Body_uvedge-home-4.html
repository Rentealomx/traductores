<h2>RECOGNIZING WOMEN WHO ROCK OUR WORLD</h2>

<p>As part of our efforts to empower women through The Ultraviolet Edge, we'll be recognizing inspirational women who rock our world&mdash;starting with a woman we've admired forever: Gwen Stefani. Like us, she has a history of breaking down barriers and hails from Orange County, California. (Fun fact: She and Wende, our founder, met back in the early days of No Doubt and UD.) We dig Gwen's innate ability to set trends and defy expectations. She also shares our passion for empowering women and will help give this initiative the attention it deserves.</p>
