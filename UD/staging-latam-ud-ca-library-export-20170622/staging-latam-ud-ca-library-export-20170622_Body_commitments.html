		URBAN DECAY'S GLOBAL INITIATIVE TO EMPOWER WOMEN
	</h2> 
	<p class="t-text-14">
		Urban Decay has always stood for the empowerment of women&mdash;from the products we create to the causes we support. When we launched in 1996, the prestige beauty market was a sea of pink, red and beige. We gave women the alternative makeup colors they craved and challenged them to defy the stereotypical notions of beauty. But it doesn't end with makeup. Urban Decay announces the launch of The Ultraviolet Edge, our global initiative to empower women. By supporting organizations that fight for the rights of women everywhere, we encourage all women to embrace their individuality in everything they do. To us, that's the definition of beauty with an edge&trade;.<br /><br />

		ANIMAL TESTING POLICY
	</h2>
	<p class="t-text-14">
		Urban Decay is a cruelty-free brand and is committed to ending animal testing. We do not test our products on animals, nor do we allow others to test on our behalf. Additionally, we require our suppliers to certify that the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are not tested on animals. Our Brand is certified by both PETA and The Leaping Bunny Program (CCIC) as cruelty-free.

		VEGAN PRODUCTS
	</h2>
	<p class="t-text-14">
		Urban Decay certifies that our products marked vegan do not contain any animal-derived ingredients. Please note that within a product category, such as Eyeshadows, some shades will be marked as vegan, and others will not. We have an ongoing initiative with our laboratories to not only create shades (and entire product lines) that are vegan from the start, but also to identify which of our non-vegan products can be converted. In many situations, plant-derived or synthetic alternatives to animal-derived ingredients become available. As long as we can deliver the same high-quality products with rich color and texture, we will convert that product to 100% vegan ingredients, so be on the lookout for new offerings.
