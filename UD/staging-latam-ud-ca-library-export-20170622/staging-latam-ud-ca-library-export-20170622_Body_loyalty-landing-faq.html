<h3 class="t-faq-headline section_headline">What is the UD Beauty Junkies program?</h3>

<div class="b-faq-content section_content">
<div>When you join UD Beauty Junkies, you&rsquo;ll get nothing but perks&mdash;like exclusive offers, gifts and early access to special promotions. You&rsquo;ll even be rewarded for your UD addiction&mdash;every purchase you make on UrbanDecay.ca or in any Urban Decay flagship store in Canada earns you points. As you earn points, UD Kickbacks get added to your account automatically. (UD Kickbacks have a monetary value good toward future purchases.) And the more points you earn, the better the perks.<br />

<div class="b-faq-content section_content">
<div>Once you become a UD Beauty Junkies member, you&rsquo;ll earn points for every purchase you make on UrbanDecay.ca or in any Urban Decay flagship store in Canada.

For a complete list of ways to earn points, make sure you&rsquo;re logged in to your UD Beauty Junkies account and click <a href="$httpsUrl('LoyaltyCustom-PointsShow')$"><strong>here</strong></a>.<br />

<br />

<ul class="t-list" style="list-style: initial; margin-left: 15px;">

</div>
</div>

<h3 class="t-faq-headline section_headline">What are the UD Kickbacks (rewards) I can earn with my points?</h3>

<div class="b-faq-content section_content">
<div>Once you earn 100 points within a calendar year, you&rsquo;ll get your first UD Kickback worth $10. After that, you&rsquo;ll get a $20 UD Kickback for every additional 200 points you earn. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown showing what you get for the first 500 points you earn:<br />
&nbsp;
<ul class="t-list" style="list-style: initial; margin-left: 15px;">
	<li>Reach 100 points in a calendar year; get a $10 UD Kickback.</li>
	<li>Reach 300 points in a calendar year; get a $20 UD Kickback.</li>
	<li>Reach 500 points in a calendar year; get a $20 UD Kickback.</li>
</ul>
<br />
But remember, it doesn&rsquo;t stop at 500 points; you keep earning $20 UD Kickbacks for every additional 200 points earned&mdash;there&rsquo;s no limit! UD Kickbacks work like cash, are good for one year, and can be redeemed on any future purchases on UrbanDecay.ca or in any Urban Decay flagship store in Canada.</div>
</div>

<h3 class="t-faq-headline section_headline">When will I receive my UD Kickbacks (rewards)?</h3>

<div class="b-faq-content section_content">
<div>Each time you earn a UD Kickback, it will be added to your UD Beauty Junkies account automatically. We&rsquo;ll always email you when you have a UD Kickback and you can log in to your account at any time to check your point balance.</div>
</div>

<h3 class="t-faq-headline section_headline">How will I receive my UD Beauty Junkies rewards?</h3>

<div class="b-faq-content section_content">
<div>Whether you shop in store or online, we&rsquo;ll email you when you earn points or get UD Kickbacks. All UD Kickbacks you earn will automatically be applied to your account. And you don&rsquo;t have to immediately redeem your rewards&mdash;you choose exactly when you want to use them. All UD Kickbacks are valid for one full year from the issue date and can be redeemed online or at any Urban Decay flagship store in Canada.</div>
</div>

<h3 class="t-faq-headline section_headline">Can I track my UD Beauty Junkies points online?</h3>

<div class="b-faq-content section_content">Yes! You can log in to your account at any time to check your points balance and find additional details about UD Beauty Junkies. Please note your UD Beauty Junkies points will automatically be added to your account once your order will be on its way to you.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<h3 class="t-faq-headline section_headline">When will my points and/or member level reset?</h3>

<div class="b-faq-content section_content">
<div>As soon as you become a UD Beauty Junkies member, you begin earning points with every purchase. Points earned between January 1 and December 31 will determine your membership level through the following calendar year. If you reached an elevated level by the end of the year, you'll continue at that level through the end of the following year (unless you are&nbsp;the points to advance even higher). If you don't meet the points required by December 31, your member level will reset to our starting level, Obsessed, on January 1.<br />
<br />
Remember: You&rsquo;ll always have access to the perks associated with your UD Beauty Junkies membership and current member level. We&rsquo;ll send you a reminder email 30 days before your points and your member level are set to expire.</div>

</div>

<h3 class="t-faq-headline section_headline">If I return a product, how does that affect my points balance and member level?</h3>

<div class="b-faq-content section_content">
<div>Whenever you make a product return, the amount of points you earned on that purchase will be deducted from your points balance. If a return results in a lower points balance than required for your current member level, your account will be adjusted to the member level that corresponds with your new points balance.</div>
