<p class="t-text-14">The discounts and special privileges associated with the UD Pro program are available to our members only. Products acquired as a result of UD Pro membership are intended for the personal and professional use by our members, and are not to be resold under any circumstances. Each member may only use one shipping address...so don't try to get sneaky! Urban Decay reserves the right to approve, deny or cancel membership at any time, and at our discretion. We may make changes to the program at any time and without prior notification. Some products will not be available for a UD Pro discount, such as limited-edition items, certain value sets, sale items, or products with limited inventory. The UD Pro discount cannot be combined with any other offers or sales. The UD Pro discount is available only at Urban Decay stores and through <a href="$url('Home-Show')$"><strong>urbandecay.com</strong></a>. The UD Pro program is currently only available in the United States, and we cannot ship internationally, although we would love to expand someday!</p>
