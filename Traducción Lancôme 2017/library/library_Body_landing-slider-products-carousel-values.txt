                            Melissa, which literally means Bees leaf, has been used since Antiquity for its medicinal benefits. In the Middle Ages, it was said to have rejuvenating properties. And under Louis XIV, the fine ladies at Court were mad about it and used it for its revitalizing effects.
                            <br> Today, it is renowned for its protective action against the inflammation and oxidative stress.

                            As quality has always been at the center of our attention, we are systematically dedicating 1 person & 5 days to checking the quality of the 30.000 units produced every day. This process includes meticulous testing of micro-biological stability, the visual aspect of each item, packaging quality & preservatives testing. Because every product count.
                            <br>And because for us, French quality must go along with responsible behavior, we are demanding of ourselves the ISO5001 norm, the most restrictive in terms of environmental responsibility. Limit greenhouse gases, dilute fossil sources, encourage green energyâ€¦
